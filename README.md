# Reinforcement Learning Agent for Doom Using VizDoom

This project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning techniques to create an autonomous agent that plays Doom by leveraging the VizDoom API. VizDoom allows developing AI agents that interact with the game Doom using the screen buffer. I have implemented various reinforcement learning strategies to understand and optimize the agent's performance in a complex, dynamic environment.

Currently i have only trained an RL agent to play the basic game, however same could be done for other levels in the game
